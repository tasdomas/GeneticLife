*** TODO
 - [ ] Conway's game of life implementation
   - [ ] benchmark script
   - [ ] integrate a unit test framework
   - [ ] ??? parallel evolution
   - [ ] visualize life
 - [ ] Genetics
   - [ ] genetic algorithm framework

*** The Idea

A simple experiment in genetic algorithms - evolve a genetic life form (a configuration of cells smaller than the whole world) that will move furthest
in N interations. Basically we init the map with only the life form at its center. And after the iterations have passed, check to find live cells.
The distance from a live cell to the center of the map is calculated and used as a health function.
